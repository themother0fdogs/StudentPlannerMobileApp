TITLE: 
Student Planner Mobile App

PURPOSE:
This is an Android Mobile Application of a student degree planner. The purpose of this application is to allow students 
to have a degree planner at their fingertips. There are planners
and apps for planning daily activities or tracking diets, but not many are specifically for degree planning.
The degree planner includes a login screen that allows students to log in with their username and password to view the data associated with them.

For busy students who have families and/or full-time jobs, it may be difficult to remember dates; therefore,
creating a planner app that has an alert system for starting and ending dates would be an aid for busy students.
Our phones are used in our everyday lives and are almost always attached to us, so providing notifications or the
ability to send emails and texts to oneself would be beneficial for planning and remembering important dates.
Along with notifications, the students would have the ability to input information about their terms, courses, and
assessments to help students plan accordingly.

The details of terms includes the term's name, start and end dates, and associated courses.
The details of courses includes the course's name, start and end dates, progress status, course instructor's contact information, 
option to add notes, and associated assessments.
The details of assessments includes the assessment's name, start and end date, and assessment type (such as an Objective or Performance Assessment).

The application will also allow the students to view a list of all their registered terms, courses, and assessments. For the list of courses
and assessments, the details of those lists contain the name of the course or assessment and the start and end dates. The list is ordered by
start date in ascending order. The course list screen includes a search bar for users to filter through the list.

The application will include options for the student to input information about their terms, courses,
and assessments. The application will also allow students to set alerts of start and end dates for courses and assessnebts that they want to
track and an option to add and share notes of the courses they are taking. The share notes options allows students to send saved notes from the appliation
through text messages, a Google Drive, e-mail, or Bluetooth.

The current data associated with each user/UserID is also added in this project for testing purposes and to show the execution of the project
based on the login user credentials.

TOOLS:
Android Studio Dolphin
SQLite
My application was developed under the minimum SDK 26 and the target SDK 32. 
With the minimum SDK version of 26, its target compatibility would be with Java 8; therefore, it requires Java 8 or higher to run properly.
To develop my application, I used the Pixel 5 API 32 emulator to test the application in units.
